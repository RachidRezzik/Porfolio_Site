                        To really practice and get more comfortable with Javascript, I thought I'd challenge myself with creating a game. Creating a game really tests your understanding of programming and was tough, but worthwhile in developing it without looking at a tutorial.

                        In my second project, I built a social media site for boxing athletes, coaches, and gym owners. Connections between the profile types, such as an athlete's teammates and coach, provide interesting/useful information for those involved in boxing professionally.

                        The user will first create one of the three profile types (athlete/coach/gym). Based on the profile type, the user will be asked for more information that can strengthen their profile and form connections to other users.

                        Once the user has created a profile, they can edit their profile picture, edit their profile information, add a picture post, search for a specific athlete/coach/gym, and browse the all the available profiles on the site.

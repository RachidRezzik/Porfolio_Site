                <p>Most gooners were very surprised to see our summer-signing Gabriel left on the bench in favor of David Luiz. Gabriel has been exceptional in his first two premier league starts and even leads the league in passing accuracy for a centerback.</p>
                <p>With that in mind, it becomes very confusing how Arteta favored David Luiz. Yes Luiz can pull off a decent long ball here and there, but some may argue the defensive stability Gabriel offers is more important against a side like Liverpool.What do the Gooners think? Leave a comment below on whether you agree with the decisions. </p> 
                <p> Dani Ceballos was also left out of the squad in favor of Elneny. Usely this would ensure more defensive stability, but I'm willing to argue it wasn't worth it against Liverpool as it drained creativity on the ball. Liverpool are most dangerous down the wings with their impressive fullbacks/wingers with attacks rarely coming straight through the middle. I feel Dani has held his own in becoming a team player willing to do his work defensively. His creativity was sorely missed and could be seen as soon as he came on.</p>

                <p>Decent effort from our boys today, but an overall dominant performance from the champions. Liverpool's quality down the flanks really proved vital as that's where all the danger came from.</p> 
                <p> The gunners did not have much ball possession at all, patiently waiting for a chance to get the ball and counter. Unfortunately, when the opportunities arose we needed more creativity or quality in the pass as the final ball was there against Liverpool's high line. Lacazette scored early on, but we'll all agree he will be kicking himself at not finishing his one0-on-one opportunity.</p>
                <p>
                I am also concerned with how some of our players are sticking with playing out of the back when they would be much better served booting the ball out of there. Against a side like Liverpool, it would take several great first-time/quick passes to break through for a chance at a counter. Overall, wish arteta was a bit more brave in his tactics as Leeds were on opening day.

                <p>Well, we got the win today, but boy was it a nervous match. West Ham looked dangerous on their counters, but luckily could not convert more than one goal.</p> 
                <p> Gabriel was truly tested today, and I think he'll take it as good experience for the pace of a Premier League game. Holding was decent, but I can't help feeling nervous when an attacker goes at him with pace.</p>
                <p>
                The main issue today was that our midfield could not prevent the counter attacks. This is where I've been crying out (for what feels like forever) for a world class defensive midfielder. Partey is the man and would provide what Fabinho provides to a championship side in Liverpool.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the end some magic from Saka made it easy for ceballos to center it to Nketiah for the winner. Happy as always for the three points.

                <p>Fantastic Performance from the boys today at Craven Cottage. The major highlights from today were provided by our two new signings!</p> 
                <p> Gabriel scored a header and Willian provided two assists. Both looked very comfortable in the team. I was very impressed with Gabriel's performance as he looked very comfortable on the ball and his passing was excellent. With Arteta liking the passing from the back, that quality is key for our team going forward.</p>
                <p>
                Willian did not look out of place at all and provided the quality when we needed it. His experience showed and it will be a battle between him and pepe. I know I'm not the only one who would like to see more fight from pepe, so hopefully this brings it out of him.

                <p>With the transfer window nearing its close, many gooners are bracing themselves hoping for at least one more summer signing. Most are hoping its either defensive midfielder Partey from Athletico Madrid or attacking midfielder Aouar from Lyon. In this article I'd like to bring up the benefits of either one (ideally we'd get both of course!).</p>
                
                <p> Let's begin with Aouar from Lyon. He's 22 years old and full of potential. He offers a quick transition from defense to offense and great close control. He would definitely add some much needed creativity to our midfield. Currently I'd say he's most similar to Ceballos, but Dani has proven he's willing to work defensively for the team in the current shape Arteta has us playing in. At Lyon, Aouar had a bit more freedom to drive the ball forward, but did show he's capable of staying deeper for the team when needed. </p>
                <p>
                Partey is 27 years old and to me, would offer more to the team. Partey wins the ball back tremendously well for Athletico and also has driving runs/great distribution to attacking players. He covers ground very well and would allow Xhaka to be in better positions to use his great left foot to find our front three.

                    <p>Sorry mate but to me Aouar would be the better signing. He's younger and would really link up well with Auba annd Laca. We need that creative spark we haven't had since Ozil in his prime.</p>

                <p>Rumor has it that Arsenal are looking to sell Torreira to Athletico Madrid. The Uruguayan was a fan favorite upon his arrival, but has since fallen out of favor.</p>
                
                <p>The obvious hope is that this deal goes through with Thomas Partey coming our way. At the very least, I would like someone coming in that can provide similar qualities to Torreira, but knowing Arsenal that might not even happen. </p>

                    <p>Would be sad to see lucas go but for Partey it would make us tremendously better. Think torreira would work well under Simeone as he's had many Uruguayan stars there.</p>

                <p>Gabriel has officially signed for Arsenal from Lille for a reported fee of $34.7m.</p>
                <p>The Brazilian will be a major addition to a team lacking defensive depth and quality. Gabriel is good in the air and does not go to ground to quickly. He's very patient, but effective in making his tackles.</p>
                <p>
                Eventually I think we all would like to see a Saliba/Gabriel partnership, but I think Saliba needs more time to develop. Good thing is both are young, so things look brighter than previous years for our defence.

                <p>Willian has officially signed for Arsenal from Chelsea on a free transfer.</p>
                <p>The Brazilian will add some experience and depth to our front line. He may be 32, but he was arguably Chelsea's most influential player last season for attacking moves.</p>
                <p>
                The move also brings Pepe's starting spot into question. Pepe has shown quality at times, but still lacks the consistency we need. With Willian for competition, hopefully Pepe will step it up and reach his potential.  
                </p>
                <p>If not, Willian will take care of business in the meantime.</p>

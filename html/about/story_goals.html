            Web Dev. Story & Goals
        </h1>
        <div class="about_body">
            <p>
                I was first exposed to the benefits of coding through the work of my boss in my last position as an Energy Analyst. His programming allowed him to build a company that brought valuable information to customers. In viewing what was possible with some hard work, I was determined to begin my own personal coding journey.</p>
            <p>
                I commenced learning python as it was the language I heard the most about. I learned some basic programming principles in variables, loops, and functions. I then found myself interested in learning data science to supplement my Analyst position. I spent the first half of 2020 practicing and studying data science. I completed two <a id="initial_data_link" href="#data_science_projects"><i>DATA SCIENCE PROJECTS</i></a>, but unfortunately found myself losing passion for it. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I then luckily stumbled upon a Youtuber's video (Chris Sean) in which I found myself inspired by how web development completely turned his life around. His passion towards his career was very contagious and I found myself wanting to learn more about a possible career for myself.</p>
            <p>
                Following his advice, I immediatley began watching and coding along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript courses (in that order) on Treehouse.com and Youtube. I made sure to make up personal mini-projects to test my newfound skills and build something new. I found myself having a lot of fun getting to be creative in a way I couldn't with data science! I've even grown frustrated at times that it took me this long to find web development, but it's better late than never!</p>
            <p>
                Eventually, I learned and practiced enough web development skills to build this portfolio website. Though I am proud of what I have been able to achieve so far, I know there's so much more I can learn to continue my progression and that's what truly excites me. In gaining my first Web Development job I can't wait to learn from other developers and become the best Front-End Developer I can be. I also see myself eventually learning and working on the Back-End as well to one day become a Full-Stack Developer. I simply can't wait to take full advantage of the first opportunity I am handed!
            </p>

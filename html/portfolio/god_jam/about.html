    <section class="about">
        <br>
        <p>The original founders of God Jam!!! are Yonny "The Chef" Sladic, Rachid "Design Man" Rezzik, and Edmundo "The Dinero Man" Perez. All throughout high school the founders found themselves obsessed with jam and how they couldn't find one worthy of the gods. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Then one day a jar fell from the skies onto Yonny's head. He was unconcious for a bit, but when he woke up he was forever changed. Yonny opened the jar of jam and tasted it. He immediately could tell all of its ingredients and proportions. Yonny ran home to the "lab" and began trying to match the jam from the skies. </p>
        <br>
        <p>When Yonny was finished he called Rachid and Edmundo to taste. The second the two tried the jam, they both yelled "God Jammmmmmm!!!" and could not get enough of it! When they asked where he got the inspiration Yonny explained that the jar fell from the skies as if from the gods. And thus, God Jam!!! was created and mass produced ever since for the great residents of Texas!</p>
